# TrajSplit

Bruteforce.py: shows the bruteforce implementation of TrajSplit Algorithm usign python where the deviation parameters (1.0, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.0) are all tested and statistics of the algorithm is gathered at each stage

Direction.py: shows the direction-heuristic implementation of TrajSplit Algorithm usign python where the deviation parameters (1.0, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.0) are all tested and statistics of the algorithm is gathered at each stage

Euclidean.py: shows the euclidean-heuristic implementation of TrajSplit Algorithm usign python where the deviation parameters (1.0, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.0) are all tested and statistics of the algorithm is gathered at each stage
